# Disaster-Response-Pipeline

## Description:
In this app, a machine learning pipeline is created to classify the emergency messages sent by users to appropriate categories. The data for training is obtained from Figure Eight Disaster Response Data. The data thus obtained is cleaned and transformed to the necessary form using the ETL pipelines and other Data Engineering techniques. Then a front-end is created using the HTML and deployed using the python FLASK library. Visit the below link for more information on Flask.

This project is divided in the following key sections:

1. Processing data, building an ETL pipeline to extract data from source, clean the data and save them in a SQLite DB
2. Build a machine learning pipeline to train the which can classify text message in various categories
3. Run a web app which can show model results in real time
